# data_projects
A repo for my data projects where I test stuff that I can present to others.

zoodom analysis is about some research I did to find which species was more relevant/engaging in Zoologico Dominicano's Instagram.
car data analysis is about some brand research to find out the most efficient models and fuel/cost ratio.
app store analysis is about finding the App genre/category with the highest opportunity for success.
hacker news about the most talked about pieces in HackerNews.
gender wage about the post college earnings and which majors have the biggest divergence.
